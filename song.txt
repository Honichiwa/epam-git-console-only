Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you

And everything you do

Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do

And it was called Yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah, your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
And you know, you know I love you so
